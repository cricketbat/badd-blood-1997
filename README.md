# badd-blood-1997


This is a video game I'm currently working on and have been since May 2016.

It is centered around the WWF PPV "In Your House: Badd Blood" and you get to interact with various wrestlers.

If you're here, I've way more likely than not linked you, so that you are able to collaborate with me or beta test for me.

Things to keep in mind:
* This is CRAZY in beta. It's in alpha. This ain't even a game.
* I am a single person.
* What I'm looking for right now is FLOW and EXPERIENCE bugs. The writing and art is nowhere near complete, nor is the music. I want to know if you hit any bugs or crashes.

Thank you very much.
